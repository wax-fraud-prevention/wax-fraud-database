## Add account or collection to database

- [ ] I have read the [`README`](README.md) and understand how to add an account or collection to the database.

### Add data to [`accounts.json`](accounts.json) or [`collections.json`](collections.json)

```json
{
  "name": "<accountname>",
  "level": "<danger, warning>",
  "reason": "<reason for being on the list>"
}
```
